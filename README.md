# Dog Fight MCP (Multi-Perspective Co-creation)

## Overview

Dog Fight MCP (Multi-Perspective Co-creation) is a framework designed to facilitate automated, structured debates among AI agents to collaboratively solve complex problems. It orchestrates a dynamic process where multiple AI "Actors," each embodying unique, predefined roles, personalities, and expertise, engage in an iterative exchange of proposals, critiques, and refinements.

The primary purpose of Dog Fight MCP is to simulate an expert panel discussion or a "think tank" environment. By leveraging diverse AI personas, the system aims to produce well-rounded, robust, and thoroughly vetted solutions that consider multiple viewpoints. It seeks to uncover deeper insights, rigorously challenge assumptions, and explore a wider range of potential strategies than a monolithic AI approach might achieve, thereby mirroring the collaborative intelligence and creative friction of a human expert team. This methodology is particularly effective for tackling multifaceted problems where no single perspective holds all the answers.

### Core Features:

*   **Multi-Actor System:** The framework employs a team of AI agents, referred to as "Actors." Each Actor is configured with a distinct profile, including its area of expertise (e.g., "Security Engineer," "Financial Analyst"), behavioral traits (e.g., "cautious," "innovative"), and specific viewpoints or objectives. This ensures that problems are examined comprehensively from multiple relevant angles.
*   **Iterative Debate Process:** Solutions are developed and refined through multiple rounds of structured interaction. In each round, Actors may generate initial proposals, provide critiques of others' ideas, offer counter-proposals, and adapt their positions based on the ongoing discussion. This iterative cycle allows for the progressive strengthening and optimization of the final solution.
*   **Scribe Functionality:** A specialized AI agent, designated as the "Scribe," plays a crucial neutral role in the debate. The Scribe is responsible for collecting, impartially summarizing, and synthesizing the diverse opinions, arguments, and proposals generated by the Actors. It then formulates coherent draft solutions that reflect the collective intelligence of the group, often highlighting areas of emerging consensus as well as points of persistent contention.
*   **Consensus Mechanism & Voting:** To help guide the debate towards a converged outcome, Actors participate in a voting process to evaluate the consolidated drafts produced by the Scribe. This mechanism helps to identify the most widely supported ideas and can be used to determine whether a proposed solution is sufficiently agreed upon or requires further debate and refinement.
*   **LLM-Powered Intelligence:** The cognitive capabilities of both the Actors and the Scribe are powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). This enables them to understand complex and nuanced problem statements, generate coherent and contextually relevant arguments, reason effectively about different proposals, and adapt their communication and strategies throughout the structured debate.

## Introduction

Dog Fight MCP is a system designed for structured, debate-style problem-solving using AI agents. It facilitates a dynamic process where multiple AI "Actors," each with unique, predefined personalities and expertise, engage in a collaborative effort to analyze complex problems and develop comprehensive solutions.

The core purpose of Dog Fight MCP is to simulate an expert roundtable, enabling the collaborative generation of well-rounded and thoroughly vetted solutions. By orchestrating this multi-perspective co-creation process, the system aims to uncover deeper insights, challenge assumptions, and explore a diverse range of potential outcomes that a monolithic approach might miss.

### Key Features:

*   **Multiple AI 'Actors':** The system utilizes several AI agents, known as "Actors," each configured with distinct personalities, areas of expertise, and specific viewpoints. This ensures a diverse range of perspectives are brought to the problem-solving process.
*   **'Scribe' for Synthesis:** A dedicated AI agent, the "Scribe," is responsible for impartially collecting, consolidating, and synthesizing the information, arguments, and proposals generated by the Actors into coherent draft solutions.
*   **Iterative Debate and Voting:** The problem-solving process involves iterative rounds where Actors generate proposals, debate their merits, and vote on consolidated drafts. This structured iteration allows for progressive refinement of ideas.
*   **Consensus-Based Solution Refinement:** While aiming for consensus, the system is designed to clearly articulate areas of agreement and disagreement. Solutions are refined based on the collective feedback and weighted arguments from the Actors, leading to more robust outcomes.
*   **Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs):** Both Actors and the Scribe are powered by advanced Large Language Models, enabling them to understand nuanced problem statements, generate human-like text, reason about complex issues, and adapt their contributions throughout the debate.
